# Beauty-Chatbot
The Beauty Product Recommender Bot is a web-based chatbot application built using FastAPI, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that provides personalized skincare product suggestions based on user input. Users simply enter their desired product type, skin type, and skin concern in natural language (e.g., "serum, oily, acne"), and the system responds with a tailored recommendation from a predefined dictionary. The interface features a clean, modern chat-style UI for interactive engagement, and the backend is lightweight with no database required, making it fast, extendable, and easy to use for beauty and skincare guidance
